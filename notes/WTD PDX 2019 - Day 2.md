# WTD PDX 2019 - Day 2
## Tuesday 5/21

### Talks

#### [Alicja Raszkowska - Draw the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/speakers/#speaker-portland-2019-alicja-raszkowska)
- HTML <ruby> tag for pronunciation
- Julia Evans; Kubernetes do technical comic/drawing designs
- Make documentation engaging; systems thinking for debugging, problem-solving (whiteboarding corollary)
- Biz case made by approaching each dept and speaking to how they each use diagrams and charts today (engineers whiteboard and sketch during pairing; tech writers use diagrams and Sketch w/ designers to explain concepts; Sales uses simple visuals to engage prospects)
- Explored various tools for drawing that would be reusable, scalable, version control, slots into existing team workflow/pipelines (tools shown draw.io, p5.js, mxGraph, etc.)
- Uses Mermaid -- open source p5.js (JS, markdown syntax, CSS styling, web-generating, web interface, CLT/workflow automation)
- Demo shows that CSS declarations set for the graphics used, can then use Mermaid GUI in browser to text edit the diagrams + icons (lightweight compared to Visio...)
- Showed that based on the CSS call, can go from her "whimsy" hand-drawn and cartoony graphics to a different CSS setup with more professional graphics and typeface
- Gotchas: htmlsvg, doesn't play well with Sketch/other SVG editors; CSS styling would need to be maintained alongside other company assets/branding changes.

#### [Sarah Moir - Just Add Data: Make it easier to prioritize your documentation](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/speakers/#speaker-portland-2019-sarah-moir)
- Describing telemetry data and web analytics (time on page, bounce rate, user IP, etc.)
- Looking and not finding
  - Search results, cases, forum questions
- More help needed?
  - Look at support, course enrollment
- Look for new use cases coming from customers (something they're doing or executing that isn't clearly documented; proactive)
- Large amount of data isn't correlated to better understanding; rather, representative data
- Focus on outliers; standard deviation
- Segment data features for more targeted analysis
- Combine pageviews, sales leads and customer numbers to get a wider picture; but be sure to differentiate between potential and current clients
- Interpret using expertise, find alternate explanations and aggregate; knowing customers rate content 3 stars in aggregate isn't as helpful to know that's an average of 1-5 stars vs. majority rate a consistent 3 stars.
- Filtering the results thru expertise on docs -- example of how someone is searching for API endpoints, but do they really mean X/Y/Z. Only we know in detail to interpret the data we gathered. API endpoints discussed on forums, so know that this topic should be prioritized.
- Data on what customers aren't using/doing can also help share what you AREN'T doing, with reasoning.
- _The Product is Docs_ (Splunk book)

#### [Matt Reiner - Show Me the Money: How to Get Your Docs the Love and Support They Deserve](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/speakers/#speaker-portland-2019-matt-reiner)
- K15t speaker (our Confluence server macro/integration provider)
- The "I can do so much more if we just `BLANK` the docs"
- Great, says manager, write a biz case! *eye roll*
- Building biz cases as TWs
- Leadership cares about impact, duplication of effort, impact on you
- Leaders care if you rewrite/redo/duplicate; if training is a cost center; reducing silos
- Prevention-focused (TW) vs. Promotion-focused (everyone else, those who are lauded); leaders care because when we aren't recognized.
- **Format shown is Exec Summary (primary focus here for skimmers) >> SWOT >> Biz Description (where we've been and how request tells us where we're going) >> Marketing strategy (how it will deployed and marketed so there's interest and excitement) >> Operations Overview >> Product Plan >> Financial Plan**
- To align w/ biz leaders, be very connected to biz plan and company goals (from the board level down to our quarterly goals)
- Know your elevator pitch to hammer in on the why
- Also know your USP
- Marketing: knowing the moments before an event and capitalizing on when to deploy
- Connect documentation to the brand identity
- Speak to Marketing in their lingo; campaigns, and how our docs would fit in and a request would satisfy
- Speak to Sales in terms of leads and opps; know that they use our content and ensure there is accuracy from what was promised/described thru the docs. Key in to the benefits, as Sales focuses on these.
- Mentions support (less relevant for us and KCS considering our model is changing drastically) -- take that feedback, throw 50% away and give support a "kb to document stuff in, and take some of it for docs" -- basically what we are do and will do w/ KCS.
- Use data! IE support deflections bc of docs means won't need more headcount; last 10 sales were lost due to docs, etc.

#### [Chris Bush - SDK Reference Manuals: A flow-based approach](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/speakers/#speaker-portland-2019-chris-bush)
- N/A to Smarsh at this point, but check talk if needed later.
- SDK/dev docs is written for implementers, not users.
- Function over form (naturally)

#### [Kay Miles - Product Documentation Strategy: What Is It and Why Do We Need It?](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/speakers/#speaker-portland-2019-kay-miles)
- 

#### [Jessica Parsons - Lessons Learned in a Year of Docs-Driven Development](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/speakers/#speaker-portland-2019-jessica-parsons)
-

#### [Jodie Putrino - Defying the Status Quo: How a grassroots effort can transform an organization](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/speakers/#speaker-portland-2019-jodie-putrino)
