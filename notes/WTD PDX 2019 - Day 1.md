# WTD PDX 2019 - Day 1
## Monday 5/20

### Day 1 Recap
- **We're all in it together.** Everyone at WTD struggles with: analytics, delivering AND soliciting feedback, knowing the end user, writing without complexity, and content siloing.
- **Exceptional conference scheduling.** WTD does a very good job of keeping the schedule moving and on-time. We started and ended according to schedule.
- **Effortless networking? It can happen to you!** Sitting at a "round table" is the best way to network without feeling like it's a burden. I got to know almost everyone at my table, and we sat together the entire day. Now the trick is keeping in touch with these colleagues in the WTD Slack and/or LinkedIn.
- **So many well-timed breaks.** 10-20 minute breaks between talks is awesome, smart, and, well, awesome.
- **Editing got several (welcomed) shoutouts.** Editing and delivering feedback came up across many talks. From Ingrid Towey's "How to edit other people's content without pissing them off" to Kathleen Juell's "Writer? Editor? Teacher?" the message was clear: collaborative, respectful editing necessitates clarity, context and reasoning. It's not enough to mark an error and hope someone understands. We can only build better writers by offering explanations and reasoning! But, we must also avoid editing per our tastes, and ensure consistency via style guides and the like.
- **Something inspiring: in-person group editing** The concept of in-person editing sessions came up many times. That seems hard to do with remote teams in different time zones. But the idea of being together to collaboratively answer "what is this doc's purpose, who is it for?" to better target content to end users is a valid concept worth exploring.
- **Open source isn't so scary after all.** Don't be afraid to jump into open source contributions! And if you find it overwhelming, create your own open source project. Even if it's a simple app, there's an eagerness within the community to contribute. But templatize the work as much as possible before juggling mass-PR insanity.

### Talks

#### Heather Stenson - Any friend of the docs is a friend of mine: Cultivating a community of documentation advocates
- Small team @ Mapbox; originally one writer, but quality docs
- How? Multiple people across the org collaborating. Even tho not part of the team, they were "Friends of the Docs."
- SMEs/meetings declined/last-minute feedback (typical story)
- What is "Friend of the Docs" - enthusiastic about docs, help in some way (feedback, suggestions)
- FotD vs SME -- SMEs know the info you need for docs, but FotD has an innate enthusiasm for the docs; SMEs you may have to hunt down.
- Help = flagging issues, improvement suggestions, proposing new, editing/fact-checking, doc advocates at company, write docs themselves.
- Making FotD -- identify spectrum....
- Doc Oblivious > Docs Aware > Docs Enthusiast > FotD
- (1) Start looking w/in -- Support (front-line self-interests); PMs (influencers); individual contributors (dev, builders; sources of truth)
- (2) Start at the top -- team leads; get face time and consistent (ie quarterly) meetings to notify them of upcoming doc-related requirements (our roadmap plan, but know we need to broadcast to specific leaders)
- (3) Share cx feedback about docs -- reinforce the good feedback w/ contributors + inspiration; also use critical feedback to encourage improvements (use opportunity to build FotD and improve not defensively)
- (4) The bottom line -- ROI, benefits, cx experience
- (5) Bribery! Exclusive stickers, t-shirts, happy hours, etc. -- the power of stuff earned thru participation (i.e. sticker to someone who tested a new guide or doc UX)
- Find FotD, **keep in touch** -- use current processes, i.e. issue tracker or chat program (example was for GitHub, creating a doc-specific issue tracker and gives whole company visibility to docs, open issues directly to docs)
  - So, perhaps changing from our email-only feedback address; open up transparency?
- Obstacles
  - Silos: Most effective solution is to open our own team's doc silo (invite others into the content, make others not on docs team comfortable)
    - Bridge silos: As TW, have unique all-up perspective on all content across silos (VCC!)
  - Obliviousness: Make doc team very vocal and visible, pub wins, proactive reachout, launches, marketing/sales/support FYIs
    - Lead the impression we are a company who cares about docs
  - Busy! Lean on the argument that spend time now saves time later (support was example, but hey VCC)
  - No response from being visible and vocal: Do targeted requests (who and what you're asking, specific contributors)
- Docs Dopamine Feedback Loop > people who reach out > we are responsive and helpful > they have a good experience > they come back
- DO: model the behavior we want to see (open issues, share, help and follow up quickly); relenquish control a bit -- FotD means won't control every sentence...control lost is gained productivity; set boundaries (so people know what to do and how to operate) (example of automated doc testing before publish so there's a gate) (some content requires TW sign off to prevent gotchas); help the helpers as much as you can (make connections, PM, adopt tasks, foster good feelings -- make FotD feel like never taken advantage of); make public announcements for helpers, be polite, give swag; stay friends w/ FotD when growth changes teams (i.e. if your team grows and needs less, stay friends)

#### Ingrid Towey - How to edit other people's content without pissing them off
- Being diplomatic AND effective
- Principles to live by:
  - All on the same side
  - EDIT not "edict" -- edits are not a command; explain WHY they should make the changes.
  - Get help; don't do it alone.
- (1) All on the same side -- we're on the customer's side
  - Example: daughter editing friend's paper, she says it's so bad how do I fix it -- advice is to tell that friend who she's writing for and the point being made, and help her.
  - Empathy, patience!
  - The customer is "right" -- what we want isn't important
- Some things are true for ALL customers (users of content)
  - You have 10 seconds before user backs out (ie formed from Google use)
  - People form an opinion of your site in 50ms
  - You have 59 seconds if your site has become trusted by a user
  - Once in your site, only read ~28%
  - CUSTOMERS SCAN; they don't read. **CX want to get back to WORK**
    - Going to your docs are already an admission of failure, they want to go back to their work
- Be aware of your audience... anecdote of a designer doing an animated rep of a diagram, all internal/sales loved it, but then **usability testing** with the actual users of the docs, and they hated it. (WE need usability testing for docs.)
- (2) Edit not edict
  - Arguing to "let go" of the desire to fix everything to your way
  - Make edits reversible
  - Editing =/= being technically proficient in every product you touch. It is collaborative and improving the outcome for your doc audience.
  - Anecdote of a doc review, title was not clear, she didn't know the details, but then reviewed the content and realized it was about a task and then asked WHY that task was beneficial; the edit was to make it a task and explained that the task improved performance
- (3) Use objectivity. Usability testing, readability tests, picking a style standard, things to give evidence to "why" change is a good one
  - Readbility tests... intros Flesch Kincaid > example of a paragraph that was a 24 on FK (so, beyond college grad) and then bringing it down to 9th grade level
  - Readability programs: readbility.io, Hemingway, etc.
  - Style guides ... google, MS, etc.
  - Global English, minimalism, DITA guidelines (add. resources)
  - Usability testing ... can have someone try to do task while reading instructions in a conference room
  - Nielsen Norman Group usability resources
- (4) Get Help!
  - Recommend group editing > schedule meeting > review in advance > focus on only a few items during group review (ie headings only, is it customer focused)> have clear writing principles
    - Have a meeting leader. Stick to agenda. No one dominates. Everyone involved. Focus on principles, not the writer.
  - Be kind!
  - Edit so others WANT us to edit their work, that they trust us and that we will do good.
  - It's all about the relationship.
- When getting feedback, assume positive intent!

#### Kathleen Juell - Writer? Editor? Teacher?
- Create docs with the right level of access
- Teaching exists at the heart of every doc
- Empower users.
- Borrowing the "teaching philosophy statement" from higher-ed; showed one from a college
  - 1 page; your concept of teaching; why, how
  - Do we know WHY we create our docs? Any reasons more compelling than others?
  - May be part of a company mission statement
  - If have to create, then think about how to create and where it will live.
- Teaching comes into play early in docs, the introduction -- giving context and essential definitions; define why; how
- Example of a Digitalocean doc >>> Define > Justify > Outline
- Focus on "understanding" over "coverage" (another teaching methodology, K-12) *Understanding by Design*; students don't do well when required to memorize. Encouraging autonomy in students to learn without being dicatated to.
- Do "concept" definitions belong in complex content?
- Explain general principles where possible
- References different context
- Explain why
- Editing as a form of teaching
  - Templates > prewriting (what is it about, what will reader accomplish) > writing (discussing code/commands...tell reader what code will do before adding the code, add code, then explain key concepts) > writing (section intros...tell reader what they will do before...transitions; tell reader what they accomplished and connected what they did with what they will do next)
- Peer editing as teaching
  - Explain your thinking (reiterated from Ingrid's talk; bring up to ESC)
  - Treating grammar as high-level (not just fixing and moving on; benefit from the discussion)
  - Ask questions in your reviews.
- Writing like a teacher: why does your doc exist, and who is it for? Asking why, clarifying; understand the goal so the reader picks up on desired principles; understand audience and accomodate experience difference as much as possible
- Write like an editor: Clarify whys; use templates; approach as a new users/newbie

#### Shannon Crabill - Documenting for Open Source
- Starting in open source (Hacktober); overwhelming and frustrating to contribute in GH and repos
- Decided to make her own project in JS then
- Halloween calculator; opened up on GH, surprised at # of PRs
- Working smarter not harder; Google; GitHub's open source management guide helped
- Survey on open source, 93% are poorly documented
- **Remember the audience: write assuming non-technical level of understanding**
- Examples of content that use adverbs like "simply, easily, you just..." etc. alienates new and learning users
- Overview on Readmes
- Include a code of conduct! Encourage safe spaces
- Duplicate PRs
  - There are MD based GH PR templates (set expectations)
- Use templates
- Properly tag

#### Mark F Iverson - Harvest Past Experience to be a Great Tech Writer
- Circuitous journey (he went from tech support to QA to dev to PM to tech writer)
- Similar to my own journey!

#### Mike Jang - How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Command Line
- slides.com/mike-1/command-line
- Empathy -- to understand CLI helps us have empathy for the dev/sysadmin users we write for
- Ideal = our docs have everything I need v. reality = frustration and trying to get to the point
- Setup your environment to match your end users (ie for Mike, that's ubuntu to match user experience)
- Reviewed SSH connections
  - Learn how to login securely
- Navigation
  - where you are in the directory, (pwd; cd, etc)
- Editing
  - nano is a great option (no Word!)
  - or, IDEs (Atom, etc.)
- Pck Management
  - brew, zips, postman, etc.
- Git
  - Cloning repos
  - Pushing/rebasing commit messages/etc.
- These skills allow you to move toward docs-as-code
- Scripts
  - Repeated commands? make scripts!
  - If you're scripting...you're programming!
- 6 essential Command Line skills (check the slides + extra skills)
- Benefits = write docs with the info readers need, feeling empathy for readers, transform your docs; docs as code

#### Paul Wallace - Localize the Docs!
-  Review the talk if we go this route.

#### Meghan Mahar - Tutorials, Tooltips, and Popups…oh MY! How to ease yourself and your users into in-app messaging.
- Initial discussion is about selecting a tool (coding capable, segmentation, etc.)
- Once you have the tool, buy-in is easy to add tooltips for common support issues, marketing and upcoming conferences, design team sending out surveys (no email that doesn't have much clickthru)
- Testing, testing, testing. Design/test, etc. In-app messaging needs QA-level review. (WalkMe required a lot of testing to deploy properly, even for in-app/CTAs/pop-ups)
- For pop-up content: allow skimming; track eye movements (think of the flow of each tooltip)
- Don't interrupt users (ie waiting until they hit the submit button on an important task to give best practices than popping up in the middle of their workflow/pissing them off)
- Give users an out (ie generating a PDF option for those who don't want to go thru the tooltip flow)
- Give second chances -- a banner about an update was closed, then enable reeopening/reminder/icon to see that info they probably closed without looking (like update notifications being ignored and closed)
- Be aware of massive amount of pop-ups and tooltips.
  - Keep a cal -- example of a basic Jira board and when tooltips are appearing on a schedule
  - Disable old messages (not repeating the content)
- W/in company, be able to push back on the excitement from across the org as momentum is gained to DO MORE and MORE in-apps. Refer to your calendar, be aware of a campaign that already ran or is going. Control the flow of info or segment even further to specific user types.

### Lightning Talks
- Emphasis again on a peer review process, in person tho. No prior homework, meeting set, read the content together, then author explains who doc is for and group reviews and if the content satisfies the goal; giving the author the review in an hour and direct immediate feedback and feeling that the content was reviewed and accepted and understood and improved
- Idea of a "docs bug bash" of a sorta code exercise to pitch, build excitement around the event; treat it like an event; follow up after. Get leadership involved. Idea here to encourage people to participate, across the org, to fix bugs/issues/errors.
- Then actually follow up and track issues and log and complete the work
- One of the talks reiterated the Techsmith SUI to disambiguate

### Unconferences
- N/A
